**Alzheimer state detector** is a neural-network, that uses convolutional-layers to identify traits of different states of Alzheimer (non-demented, moderate-demented, mild-demented, very mild-demented), trained on over 4k MRI scans. The neural network is inputted an MRI scan of a brain and outputs the probabilistic classification of the Alzheimer's disease state.
